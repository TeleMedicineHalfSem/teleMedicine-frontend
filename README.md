# Easy Care
EasyCare offers the ultimate feature in the medical service system by providing easy 
access to users helping them consult doctors virtually.

EasyCare System is a web based application which will work as a digital hospital. The users can 
register/signIn as either a doctor or a patient. The user signed in a patient can browse through 
the list of doctors available at that time and can filter their options based on specialisation 
and/or gender. The patient can send in chat requests to the doctor and can chat with the doctor as 
per convenience. The doctor, after the meet will have to create a medical record with details such as 
patient name, symptoms, prescription, extra notes etc.
